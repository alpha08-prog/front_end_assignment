## Q1 Leveraging AI in front-end delivery
- Describe, with concrete examples, how you would use AI-powered coding or design assistants to accelerate front-end development in a startup where shipping fast matters but code quality can’t slip.
### Answer:-
- In a startup environment, speed is critical as much as quality is. AI tooling such as GitHub Copilot or Amazon CodeWhisperer can significantly streamline front-end coding by autocompleting the code,
completing boilerplate parts, and suggesting the best implementations in real time. For instance, while crafting a React dashboard, Copilot can create form components and also provide validation logic suggestions,
offloading manual labor. Design assistants such as Figma's AI plugin can automatically translate wireframes into responsive HTML/CSS snippets with design fidelity.
Linting and testing tools such as DeepCode or SonarLint guarantee AI code follows best practices and doesn't sacrifice maintainability. By plugging these tools into the CI/CD pipeline,
we can detect regressions early and maintain high code quality while delivering new features rapidly. Teams can consequently concentrate on improving UX and logic instead of re-inventing UI elements.

## Q2 Inventing an AI feature for class 11 students
- You’re tasked with designing a new AI feature that makes Physics revision easier for Indian class 11 students. Outline two key features and sketch the user journey in plain text.

  ### Answer:-
  - Visual Concept Summarizer: Transforms textbook chapters into concise, interactive visual summaries with diagrams and voiceovers.

- Doubt Solver Bot:
  ---
   Students can photograph a question, and the bot describes the solution step by step, varying its style according to the student's learning level.

- User Journey:
  ---
A user logs in and chooses "Electromagnetic Induction." The AI offers a 5-minute animated overview with important formulas and images. He watches and clicks "Ask a Doubt," takes a photo of a challenging numerical.
The bot solves it visually, describing each formula and reasoning applied. It even recommends similar practice questions, making a confusing subject a confidence booster.
